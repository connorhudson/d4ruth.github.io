thirdMessage = "Here's another $2, sweetie! I wish I could send more but Dad thinks you should try to work for a really good GPA... I suggested -500,000. Keep up the good work, and always remember that I'm proud of you!<br><br>XOXO,<br>Mom"

dadiqmessage = "Dearest child,<br><br>I'm disappointed to see you spend so much time improving GPA when such a silly number doesn't matter in the real world. What actually matters is living frugally and being smarter than your peers, for even if they can boast of a high GPA, you can always point to your wall of MENSA memberships and say you're simply too smart to try in school. I have enclosed my copy of <i>The Complete Works of Kant</i> and hope they prove enlightening. I've heard they're worth 100 IQ points.<br><br>With greatest sincerity,<br>Father"

rickmessage = "Hey sport! Ol' Uncle Rick is in a bit of a tight spot and noticed your... whatever weird business you have going on at CU is quite profitable. I talked with your parents and they agreed that since they're paying for your education anyways, they'd be cool with me borrowing $250 from you. It's not like you need it or anything, you know? My brother went on his usual 'frugality' rant, but your momma is such a sweetheart and totally understood my situation.<br><br>Take care, sport!<br>Uncle Rick"

dadmoneymessage = "Dearest Child,<br><br>I see that in addition to living frugally you are also increasing your IQ at great speeds. This pleases me, for IQ is the ultimate number. I've given you $1. Cherish that dollar forever, my spawn.<br><br>With greatest sincerity,<br>Father"
