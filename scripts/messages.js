firstMessage = "Hi sweetie!<br><br>I logged into your MyStudentHub account and saw your GPA is going up. I'm so happy you're finally back on track. Dad and I are very proud of you. I've enclosed $5 as a reward for my little baby trying hard at school! If you keep up the good work, I'll talk with Dad about sending more ;)<br><br>XOXO,<br>Mom"

secondMessage = "Hi again sweetie!<br><br>I see you're still working hard at school. Here's a bit more: $10! Hopefully all this money doesn't make you complacent ;)<br><br>XOXO,<br>Mom"

thirdMessage = "Here's another $20, sweetie! I wish I could send more but Dad thinks you should try to work for a really good GPA... I suggested -500,000. Keep up the good work, and always remember that I'm proud of you!<br><br>XOXO,<br>MOM"
