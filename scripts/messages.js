dadiqmessage = "Dearest child,<br><br>Thank you for improving your GPA so much. While I believe such a silly number has no real bearing on your value as a person (that would be IQ), it <i>does</i> get you scholarships that lower the cost of college, and also makes mother proud.

My brother went on his usual 'frugality' rant, but your momma is such a sweetheart and totally understood my situation.<br><br>Take care, sport!<br>Uncle Rick"

If the calculations you taught us how to do are right, these textbooks will give you a total of 2000 IQ points."
